            Mixing together max cushioning and speed like never before, the HOKA ONE ONE Clayton might be the one shoe that does it all. The forefoot is firmer than the heel to enable better propulsion at toe-off, but the softer rear half of the shoe cushions a midfoot strike. The thick RMAT outsole adds overall cushioning with great rebound and the broad platform is stable and disperses impact over a large area. Oh, and it's very light.

            Great shoe for the daily grind. I began using Hoka One One with the addition of the first generation CLifton to Hoka's line, I ran through my first pair and skipped the CLifton 2 as the toe-box had shrunk. The Clifton 3 has of course been a welcomed shoe for me as I prefer a larger toe-box. I recently bought another pair to add to the rotation and will need another in a couple months. I am a heavy supinator and tend to wear through the medial side of a shoe quickly and the Clifton tends to do well for me as far as durability is concerned.
            I train for marathons but I don't race in the Clifton as I prefer the cushy feel for my training days.

            I run between 25 and 30 miles a week and run a couple of marathons and 50k trail runs every year. I wanted the Clayton for a distance road running shoe. I typically like firmer shoes and the RMAT midsole feels really good. The biggest problem I find is that the toebox is simply too shallow. I find my foot burning from the restrictive upper by the end of even a 4 mile run. I have pretty wide feet, so always purchase a men's shoe for distance running and even the men's is just too tight. Hopefully, you all will improve the upper to be a little more forgiving. I will still give the shoe a solid recommendation even though I will probably not be able to use it for long runs.

            I've loved my previous HOKAS and went for this lighter shoe based on another Marathoner and sales rep recommendation. there is probably nothing wrong with this shoe. It is beautifully light. It's actually really good looking too. However within 15 miles my lower back is killing me. I'll avoid lighter weight bottles in the future. I'm sure this is an excellent shoe however for somebody like me 56 avid runner for years I've been off my feet and off running for a week now.
